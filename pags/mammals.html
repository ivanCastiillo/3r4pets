              <p class="card-text">The kitten's character will already be formed between the second and seventh week of life, and its behavior in the future will depend on the experiences lived in this time. The kitten's curiosity knows no bounds. No matter how hard you try to hide something, it will eventually be found.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Have you fallen in love with a bunny and have not been able to resist its charms? We are not surprised. They have that huggable look that every self-respecting animal lover would want to have one in their home. But to be able to take care of one, it is essential to know them first.</p>
              <p class="card-text">To get to know our new friend a little better, we have to think about how wild rabbits live: enjoying outdoor runs and sniffing the flora of the place everywhere. But being sociable and highly intelligent animals, they are easily domesticated, always respecting an adaptation period. Over time they will come to respond to their name and are able to learn tricks in exchange for their favorite snacks.</p>
